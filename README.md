# javascript-learning

This is my learning journey in JavaScript

I am using Udemy to learn JavaScript, and each folder is a different section of Jonas Schmedtman's course that you can find in the link below.

Please do not use this as a guide to learn JavaScript. I am just documenting what I am learning.
